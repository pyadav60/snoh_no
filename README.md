## Wh-what?
You are a penguin. A very... naughty penguin. You may or may not have evaded all of your taxes, and the snowman government may or may not be after you.
Evade as many taxes as possible, throw snowballs to destroy them, and try to reach a highscore of 5000!

## Controls
- DPAD - movement
- A - While moving, press to throw a snowball in the same direction. Snowballs destroy all taxes in their path, but only one can be active at any time
- B - Enter tax evasion mode! Don your red sunglasses and become invincible to all taxes. This ability cannot be spammed.
- START - play and pause
- SELECT - view highscores

## How to run
A Gameboy Advance, or GBA emulator is required to play this game.
I recommend mGBA as that's what we used in class.
I've only uploaded the final Project.gba ROM.
If you have the physical hardware to run it, you totally can!
This has been tested on a real working GBA, just plop the ROM file into a microSD / SD slot cartridge and voila!
